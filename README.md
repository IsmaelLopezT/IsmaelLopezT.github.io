# Data Visualization Project
I worked on this data visualization of New York City and Chicago with two others. The visualization captues the similarities and differences between the two citites, regarding the metrics: population density, income, crime rate, and life expectancy (all taken from census track data). My contributions to this project were the color discrimination function for the json file data, the event function for the slider which also color discriminates by district, and small formatting changes to buttons and allignment. I was able to read the json file and apply the appropriate shade of color to the corresponding district, New York City or Chicago. At the push of either metric, the maps of New York City and Chicago are colored in depending on the intensity of their corresponding values.

Thank you for viewing!
