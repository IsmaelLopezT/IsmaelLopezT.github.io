Data Visualization Project

This data visualization project makes use of JavaScript's D3 library along with HTML and CSS. I worked on it with two other individuals along with the guidance of our data vizualization professor. My main contributions to the project were the implementation of the range slider which descriminates the coloring of the different districts within New York City and Chicago, given a range for any metric provided (population, income, crime rate etc.). I also implemented the function which discriminates the coloring of the districst provided the census tract data in the json files. Smaller contributions were small tweaks to the buttons and alignment of the New York City and Chicago maps.

Thank you for viewing!
